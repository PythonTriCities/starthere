# PythonTriCities demo first.

This is a simple demo to make sure our new users have Python set up and working

## Getting Started

1. Create the virtual environment if it doesn\'t exist:

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

2. Start your virtual environment.

```
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```

3. Test that it is not legacy Python, ie 2.7

```
python --version
```

should show something like this:
```
Python 3.6.4
```
